Hello guys! My name is Pedro I'm an it engineer and I created this github account to store all my code that is useful for you!

I'm more on Linux side so most part of my scripts here will be in shell.

Also I'm a Python developer so you sould see some Python code here too, and if i find something useful on the internet I'll always share here.
